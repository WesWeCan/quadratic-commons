        <p>You’re about to participate in a quadratic voting round for collective decision making.</p>

        <h3>Quadratic Voting</h3>
        <p>Quadratic voting is voting ‘not by direction but by <em>degree</em>.’ Instead of a typical ‘A/B’ vote, you will spread your votes across a number of issues to express the intensity of your preferences.</p>

        <h3>Voting Credits</h3>
        <p>For this voting round you’ve received {{ props.credits }} credits. You may use these credits to vote in favour of or oppose a number of issues. At the end of the voting round, all votes will be tallied to find out what the group cares about most.</p>

        <h3>Cost of Votes</h3>
        <p>Your first vote costs 1 credit. Two votes costs 4 credits (2², two squared). Three votes costs 9 credits (3², three squared). The interface will help you keep track of your votes during each voting round.</p>

        <h3>Spread Your Votes</h3>
        <p>The more you spread your votes across different issues, the more voting power you exercise. This is a result of the quadratic mathematics. Spreading votes also encourages all voters compromise.</p>
