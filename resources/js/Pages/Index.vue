                <p>
                    Quadratic Voting is a collective decision-making procedure that allows you to express the intensity
                    of your preferences on a number of issues. Each voter receives credits to spread across several
                    ballot issues. The more a voter spreads their votes, the more voting power is exercised, thanks to
                    the quadratic mathematics behind the procedure. This encourages all voters to compromise and ensures
                    that the group's preferences are accurately represented.
